Each location operates Sun-Fri from 3pm to 6pm w/ 
	an hour on either side for setup/teardown

This requires 3 workers at 40hr per week.
Assuming $15/hr and a 1.5x cost of employment...
3 * 40 * 15 * 1.5 = $2,700 / wk

This requires ~175 dogs per week (assuming 20% discount):
175 * $20 * .8 = $2,800 / wk

Supporting 175 dogs per week requires about 5 paid dogs/hr:
5 * 6 * 6 = 180 with a flat distribution

Assuming 2/3 of business is on Saturday and Sunday and near 6pm:
Estimated peak of 42 dogs on Saturday at 6pm.
