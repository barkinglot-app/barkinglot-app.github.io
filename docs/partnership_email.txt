Subject Line: "Transform Your Parking Lot, Increase Your Customer Base with BarkingLot"

Dear [Business Owner],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [Your Name] and I am the founder of BarkingLot, a unique service designed to bridge the gap between pet ownership and everyday convenience.

Our concept is simple but powerful: we offer a secure, staffed space in your parking lot where customers can leave their pets while they shop at your business. With minimal footprint and maximum impact, BarkingLot ensures your customers donâ€™t have to choose between running errands and spending time with their beloved dogs.

Why Partner with BarkingLot?

Drive More Traffic: By partnering with BarkingLot, your business instantly becomes more appealing to the 65.1 million U.S. households with dogs. Pet owners who may have previously skipped a shopping trip because they didn't want to leave their pets unattended now have a compelling reason to choose your store.

Stand Out from Competition: In today's competitive landscape, every edge counts. Offering a pet care solution like BarkingLot sets you apart from the competition and reinforces your commitment to customer service.

Minimal Imposition, Maximum Return: BarkingLot operates with a minimal footprint, using only a small section of your parking lot. However, the potential return in terms of increased customer traffic and sales can be substantial.

Licensed and Insured: Rest assured knowing BarkingLot is fully licensed and insured, maintaining a safe and professional environment for pets and providing peace of mind for your customers.

Positive Community Perception: Hosting BarkingLot signals that your business supports pet-friendly initiatives and innovative solutions, which can enhance your reputation in the community.

In essence, BarkingLot brings added convenience to your customers, draws in new clientele, and positions your business as an innovative leader in customer service.

We'd love to discuss this opportunity further with you and answer any questions you might have. Please let us know if you're open to a meeting or phone call to explore a potential partnership.
