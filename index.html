								<h3>About Us</h3>
							</header>
<p><span class="bl">BarkingLot: Born Out of Love for Dogs and Need for Convenience</span></p>
<p>Like every story worth telling, the story of <span class="bl">BarkingLot</span> began with two lovable miniature goldendoodles named Buffer and Proxy, who were always eager to tag along on every adventure.</p>
<p>Their owner, Jeremy, shared an unbreakable bond with them. Every trip to the dog park, every fetch session, and every playful encounter with other dogs was a shared joy. But there was a persistent problem that stood in their way: the fact that not all errands were dog-friendly.</p>
<p>Whenever Jeremy needed to step into stores that didn't allow dogs, Buffer and Proxy had to stay behind, expressing their frustration with woeful eyes. This was not only a heart-wrenching sight, but also an inconvenience that needed a solution.</p>
<p>In a world where dogs are no longer just pets but cherished companions, Jeremy realized that the interaction with dogs had evolved and people sought to include their dogs in their everyday lives more than ever before. Thus, the need for a solution that allowed people to carry on with their everyday chores, without leaving their furry friends behind, became increasingly evident.</p>
<p>Fueled by the desire to spend more time with Buffer and Proxy, and driven by the frustration of pet restrictions in certain public spaces, the idea of <span class="bl">BarkingLot</span> was born. <span class="bl">BarkingLot</span> was envisioned as a service that could transform parking lots into secure, enjoyable spaces where dogs could be left under the care of loving professionals.</p>
<p>The goal was to honor the restrictions of stores while also respecting the bond between people and their pets, offering a convenient solution to the modern pet owner's dilemma.</p>
<p>This vision wasn't just about Buffer and Proxy; it was about all the dogs whose eyes sparkle at the sight of a leash and all the people who love their dogs too much to leave them behind.</p>
<p>Today, <span class="bl">BarkingLot</span> is a testament to that love and convenience. It stands as a solution for those who view their pets as family and strive to include them in every part of their lives. So go ahead, run your errands, enjoy your shopping, and remember that with <span class="bl">BarkingLot</span>, your pup is just a parking lot away.</p>
<p>Join us at <span class="bl">BarkingLot</span> â€“ because we believe no dog should be left behind.</p>
